# USHA (Ultra Secure Hashing Algorithm)
This package allows people to use the Ultra Secure Hashing Algoritm to hash and store sensitive data; such as password, and emails. This was designed for my own personal use but I decided to let everyone have access to this incredibly useful tool to implement into their applications.

**Install**
```
git clone https://github.com/werdane/usha/
```
